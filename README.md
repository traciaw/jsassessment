I am sorry I didnt complete it! 

What did you like about this project?
    Challenge myself to use what i learnt to make a game
What did you struggle with in this project?
    Everything. I could not understand how to combine all information to make it work together. 
    i could not understand how map function work and generation of x,y axis.

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
    reading up everything on javascript again. Not use the template given, and as a guide only. The flow will be clearer if i redo it from the start.
    Understand how information can be represented as images instead of data.
